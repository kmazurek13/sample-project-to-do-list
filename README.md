# sample-project-to-do-list

A simple to-do list application for demonstrating Vue 3 + TypeScript.

This is step 6.

In this step, we'll use everything we've learned to pull together a fully functional to-do list application.

## Step 6: Adding and Editing Tasks

In this step, we'll add the ability to add and edit tasks.

I've added a new component, `AddModifyTaskDialog.vue`, which will be used to add and edit tasks.
This component is invoked by the `ToDoView.vue` component which now a data table and add/edit/delete buttons.

## Next Steps

Now we have a fully functional to-do list application.

Hopefully you learned a few things about Vue 3 and TypeScript along the way.

Now go apply what you've learned.
